    "# Monte Carlo Method for Estimating Pi - Kyle Donald\n",
    "\n",
    "A Monte Carlo method uses random numbers to compute a value that is not random, but is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we look specifically at one Monte Carlo method: using random numbers to estimate the value of π.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the formula for a unit circle (x^2 + y^2 = 1), we will look at the upper right quadrant of the circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two random values between 0 and 1 will be generated - we can think of these as the x and y values.\n",
    "\n",
    "If x^2 + y^2 > 1, then the point generated is outside of the circle. For example if we generate random numbers and they were both 0.8 we would have 0.8^2 + 0.8^2 = 1.28.\n",
    "\n",
    "If x^2 + y^2 <= 1, then the point generated is inside of the circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method for computing π by this Monte Carlo method is: π ≃ 4 · (outcomes inside the quarter-circle)/(total number of outcomes)\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated several times to get further estimates of π.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is produced each time the code runs to visualise how the estimations of π tend to become more accurate with more iterations, but this is not always necessarily the case. "
